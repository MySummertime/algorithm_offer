As we all know that (a + b) == (a ^ b) + ((a & b) << 1), we use this feature to complete the bit operation;

  We use recursive method there, but the iterative method is good too;
  
  
  class Solution {
  public:
      int add(int a, int b) {
          return b == 0 ? a : add(a ^ b, (a & b) << 1);
      }
  };
